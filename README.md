> "Researchers' View on Using LLMs in Systematic Literature Reviews"

## Repository Content

## Abstract

Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) have drawn attention from researchers interested in conducting Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR). Some studies have shown both benefits and drawbacks in adopting LLMs in SLRs. At the same time, it is unknown what the real opinion of researchers is about adopting LLMs in their reviews. Objective: This paper presents what researchers think about LLMs and their impact on the SLR process. Method: We applied socio-technical grounded theory (STGT) to collect data from 31 researchers who used LLMs to conduct SLR. We iteratively analyze, interpret, and synthesize data, particularly on how researchers used LLMs and the associated benefits and drawbacks. Results: Researchers believe LLMs can increase their productivity by: (i) supporting them to design and refine SLR protocol; (ii) optimizing time-consuming tasks (especially in study selection and data processing); and (iii) providing cognitive support for decision-making and instant feedback. In addition, while researchers believe that LLMs can contribute to developing their research skills (e.g., gap identification, critical thinking, and argumentation), they are hesitant to trust LLM results entirely, including in making complex analyses. Conclusion: LLMs influence SLR design/execution, also having the potential to benefit researchers, enabling them to focus on insightful activities.
